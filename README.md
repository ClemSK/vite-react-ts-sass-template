# vite-react-ts-sass-template

Template for Vite React TypeScript Sass projects

FYI Vite does not do type checking, which is why the build is so fast. From this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/qrszys/is_anyone_working_with_vite/)

To have type-checking run `tsc --noEmit` as part of your build process, or just every now and then.
